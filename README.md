# Deep Learning Based Diagnosis, Abnormality and Common Disorders detection using Knee Magnetic Resonance Imaging

---
We will be implementing deep learning baselines for detecting general abnormalities and specific diagnoses (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] tears and meniscal tears) on knee MRI exams.Given a MRI scan our deep learning model will be predicting 3 outcomes for knee MRI exams (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] tears, meniscal tears, and general abnormalities). [ Code coming soon]

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee is the standard of care imaging modality to evaluate knee disorders, and more musculoskeletal MR examinations are performed on the knee than on any other region of the body.The most common indications for the knee MRI examinations in this study included acute and chronic pain, follow-up or preoperative evaluation, injury/trauma.We have used the [MRNet dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/)  which consists of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center.For more details refer to the paper related to this study [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002699)
